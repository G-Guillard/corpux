Corpux is a suite containing two programs :

- corpux-keylogger : listen for keystrokes under an X environment and
   store informations about typed characters for each X program used ;

- corpux-analyzer : analyze the logfiles generated by corpux-keylogger
   and create tables representing the frequency of each n-gram.


## Dependencies

```
libxi-dev python
```

## Build

```
make
```

## Usage

Simply run (from the corpux directory) :

```
./corpux-keylogger
```

Let it run in background while you use your X environment normally, then 
exit it with Ctrl+C.  The best would be to include this commande in your
.xinitrc file or something.

To analyze data, run :

```
./corpux-analyzer
```

You can provide a list of words to be ignored in order to prevent them to
bias statistics (e.g. your name, logins, passwords, etc.) — see the file 
"ignore_example".

See `corpux-keylogger -h` and `corpux-analyzer -h` for options.
